# jupyter-notebooks
A collection of my own Jupyter Notebooks using the Python 3.5 Kernel.

The contents of this git include:

1. An explanation of a simple data preprocessing, analytics and display module called dpad for commonly used techniques in Data Analytics (yet-to-add!)
2. A simple decision tree classifier for the iris data set (80% training, 20% testing)
3. A comparison of classification accuracies of three commonly used models for the Titanic Survivability problem.
