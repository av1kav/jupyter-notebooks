# jupyter-notebooks
A collection of my own Jupyter Notebooks for learning and experimentation. 

The contents of this repo include:

1. An implementation of LeNet-5 from scratch using only Numpy, Python and a lot of duct tape (`numpyNN.ipynb`)
2. An analysis of marketing campaign effectiveness using Survival Analysis on a Bank Marketing dataset (`SurvivalTimeAnalysis.ipynb`)

### Legacy
- A simple decision tree classifier for the iris data set (80% training, 20% testing)
- A comparison of classification accuracies of three commonly used models for the Titanic Survivability problem.
- Exploring the Convolution Operation in Convolutional Neural Networks
- A Sequence-2-Sequence Bidirectional LSTM for (non-gibberish!) Lord of The Rings poetry generation
