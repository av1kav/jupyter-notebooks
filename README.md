# jupyter-notebooks
A collection of my own Jupyter Notebooks for learning and experimentation. 

The contents of this repo include:

1. `numpyNN.ipynb`: An implementation of LeNet-5 from scratch using only Numpy, Autograd and a lot of duct tape 
2. `SurvivalAnalysis.ipynb`: Assessing marketing campaign effectiveness using Cox regression on a UCI Bank Marketing dataset

### Legacy
- `dtree.ipynb`: A simple decision tree classifier for the iris data set (80% training, 20% testing)
- `manyclassifiers.ipynb`: A comparison of classification accuracies of three commonly used models for the Titanic Survivability problem.
- `convolutionkernels.ipynb`: Exploring the Convolution Operation in Convolutional Neural Networks
- `LOTR LSTM.ipynb`: A Sequence-2-Sequence Bidirectional LSTM for (non-gibberish!) Lord of The Rings poetry generation.

Datasets are not included, but all newer notebooks should pull them from configured sources at runtime.
