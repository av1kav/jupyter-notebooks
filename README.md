# jupyter-notebooks
A collection of my own Jupyter Notebooks for learning and experimentation. 

The contents of this repo include:

1. An explanation of a simple data preprocessing, analytics and display module called dpad for commonly used techniques in Data Analytics (yet-to-add!)
2. A simple decision tree classifier for the iris data set (80% training, 20% testing)
3. A comparison of classification accuracies of three commonly used models for the Titanic Survivability problem.
4. Exploring the Convolution Operation in Convolutional Neural Networks
5. A Sequence-2-Sequence Bidirectional LSTM for (non-gibberish!) Lord of The Rings poetry generation
6. An implementation of LeNet-5 from scratch using only Numpy, Python and a lot of duct tape
